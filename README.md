# featureEngeneeringModules
Instead of hand-coding the preprocessing of data within a data science life cycle project, you can make use of these modules to automatically preprocess your data  

These modules are a part of a project called DataOne (like rapidMiner)
DataOne particularity is to create use cases of a bunch of domains in which we deal with their common problematics through a data science lifecycle, hence using the model directly or, we can exploit the resulted model using transfer learning for a different task.
You can make use of these modules separately depending on your case.
Before using them, you can test each module by exploring and running "testModules.rar" and install the specified requirements
